Simple test: Just open this URL in your browser:

http://localhost/kolektrash/backend/api/debug_task_generation.php

This will show you the current team formation.

For December 4, 2025, use these SQL commands in phpMyAdmin:

```sql
-- Scenario 2: 2 drivers, 3 collectors, 1 truck
UPDATE truck SET status = 'maintenance' WHERE truck_id != 1;
UPDATE truck SET status = 'available' WHERE truck_id = 1;

UPDATE attendance 
SET verification_status = 'verified' 
WHERE attendance_date = '2025-12-04' 
  AND session = 'AM' 
  AND user_id IN (17, 94, 28, 29, 31);
```

Then run the debug URL again to see the team formation.
